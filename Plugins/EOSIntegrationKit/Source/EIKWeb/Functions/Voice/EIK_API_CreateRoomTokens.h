	*In order to join a voice conference on a media server, users need to provide a room token.

	The createRoomToken request queries these tokens for a list of ProductUserIds, using player IP addresses to choose a server close to a player's location. The player IP address is optional, however for the best user experience, we recommend including this data. This is because a server close to a player's location has low network latency during the voice session.

	If the specified roomId does not exist, it is created.

	The result contains the players room tokens as well as the endpoint for the media server that hosts the voice session.
