/**
 * Discord Game Subsystem
 *
 * Base subsystem to manage the Discord GameSDK.
 *
 * This handles loading the Discord GameSDK DLLs and automatically reconnecting
 * to Discord as needed. This doesn't actually DO anything with the GameSDK
 * other than load it and actively manage the connection.
 *
 * You are expected to create your own derivative subsystem to implement any
 * functionality you wish to have in your game. For an example, see
 * `UCustomDiscordGameSubsystem` in the sample project.
 * 
 * @see https://github.com/XistGG/DiscordGameSample/Source/DiscordGameSample/CustomDiscordGameSubsystem.h
 * @see https://github.com/XistGG/DiscordGameSample/Source/DiscordGameSample/CustomDiscordGameSubsystem.cpp
 *
 * If you prefer, you can configure this in DefaultGame.ini by setting some INI such as:
 *
 *   [/Script/DiscordGame.DiscordGameSubsystem]
 *   ClientId=1192487163825246269
 *   CreateRetryTime=5.0
